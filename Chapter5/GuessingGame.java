/**
 * Write a program that chooses a random number between 1 and 100. Then asks the user to enter a guess. If they guess right then tell them they win, otherwise tell them if they guessed too high or low. Keep asking the user to guess until they get the right answer. Use classes to separate the different concerns of this program.
